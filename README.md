## Technologies

- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS, React Router, react-responsive, Zustand
- **Data / GraphQL:** GraphQL, Apollo Client
- **Development & Testing:** TypeScript, React Testing Library, GraphQL Codegen, Vitest, ESLint, Mock Service Worker (MSW), Playwright
- **Code Quality:** ESLint, TypeScript strict mode, comprehensive test coverage

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/santiagosagu/blossom-technical-test.git
cd blossom-technical-test
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Configuration

No additional configuration or .env setup is required to simplify the project review process.

## Features

### Core Requirements

The project implements all requirements outlined in the provided guide:

- **Character View:** Following the provided design, displaying fields such as image, name, status, species, and gender
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a smooth and usable experience on multiple screen sizes
- **Sorting:** Button to sort characters alphabetically (A-Z or Z-A)
- **Character Details:** Selecting a character in the sidebar shows a detail view using React Router
- **Comments Section:** Additional section allows adding comments on characters

### Beyond Requirements

Going above and beyond the minimum specifications:

- **TypeScript & GraphQL Codegen** for type-safe development
- **Soft-delete:** Deleted characters are stored in localStorage using Zustand
- **Advanced Filtering System:** Filter by character type (All, Starred, Others) and species (All, Human, Alien)
- **Search Functionality:** Real-time search through character names
- **State Management:** Robust state management with Zustand for filters, characters, and UI state
- **Accessibility:** Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure

## Testing Strategy

This project demonstrates a **production-level testing approach** that significantly exceeds the requested 3 unit tests:

### Test Coverage: 93.76%

```
File                    | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines
-----------------------|---------|----------|---------|--------
All files              |   93.76 |    83.47 |   79.54 |   93.76
```

### Unit & Integration Tests

- **Comprehensive Component Coverage:** Testing of all major UI components including Sidebar, CharacterItem, Character details, and responsive layouts
- **Custom Hook Testing:** Thorough testing of `useCharacterActions`, `useFilter`, and state management hooks
- **Store Integration:** Zustand store interactions and state persistence validation
- **Mock Service Worker (MSW):** Reliable API mocking for consistent test environments

### End-to-End Testing (Playwright)

**Additional E2E testing implementation** to validate complete user workflows:

- **Filter Workflow Testing:** Open/close filter panel, select filters, apply changes, and verify results
- **Search & Sort Validation:** Complete user search and alphabetical sorting functionality
- **Multi-Filter Combinations:** Testing complex filter combinations (species + character type)
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Automated testing across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit
- **Responsive Behavior:** Ensuring functionality works across different viewport sizes

### Regression Testing

- **State Persistence:** Comprehensive testing of localStorage functionality and data consistency
- **API Integration:** GraphQL query testing with proper error handling
- **UI State Management:** Testing of complex state interactions and edge cases

## Running Tests

### Unit & Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test

# Generate detailed coverage report
npm run coverage

# Run tests with verbose output
npm run test -- --reporter=verbose
```

### End-to-End Tests

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npx playwright test

# Run with visual browser (see tests in action)
npx playwright test --headed

# Run specific test suite
npx playwright test filters.spec.ts

# Run specific test by name
npx playwright test --grep "should filter characters by species"

# Debug mode (step-by-step execution)
npx playwright test --debug

# Interactive test runner with UI
npx playwright test --ui

# Run only on Chrome
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Generate and view HTML test report
npx playwright test
npx playwright show-report

# Run tests with trace for debugging
npx playwright test --trace=on
```

### Development Scripts

```bash
# Generate TypeScript types for GraphQL queries
npm run codegen

# Lint code
npm run lint

```

## Technical Highlights

This implementation showcases:

### Code Quality & Architecture

- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript implementation with strict mode and GraphQL codegen
- **State Management:** Efficient Zustand implementation with proper state normalization
- **Performance:** Optimized re-renders, useMemo for expensive computations, and efficient data structures

### Testing Excellence

- **Beyond Requirements:** 88.26% test coverage vs. requested 3 unit tests
- **Multi-Layer Strategy:** Unit, integration, E2E, and regression testing
- **Professional Tools:** Playwright for E2E, MSW for API mocking, comprehensive assertions
- **Real User Scenarios:** Testing complete user workflows and edge cases

### Developer Experience

- **Comprehensive Tooling:** ESLint, TypeScript, GraphQL codegen, and testing setup
- **Documentation:** Clear README with detailed testing instructions
- **Debugging Support:** Proper test debugging setup and trace generation
